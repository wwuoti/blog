Sometimes when you read something difficult, you tend to skip over it.
Maybe it doesn't make sense, maybe you just don't care enough about it.
What you should really do is the following:

> **Write that thing down. Write that thing down.**

Write it down anywhere. A napkin, piece of paper next to you.
Just somewhere where you can access it later.

Try to remember a moment from your past where you were faced with a difficult concept.

I have one example. And I was bored to death by it.

I was 14 years old reading tech magazines. The first one had a very consumerist one, the other one had some generic consumerist content, but most of it was reserved for professional software engineer content.

Articles on the various tech companies. Some specific stories on why you should choose this or that kind of storage you should choose for your enterprise. How consultancies operated.

And public cloud.

This was the early 2010s, public cloud services by AWS, Azure and GCP had started to expand rapidly.

Sure, there was a point for this. You'd need to know what the public cloud is if you were developing aything related to web-hosted infrastructure. These seconds

But to a 13-year old looking on the info for the next generation of GPUs? Or what kind of features the latest version of Android brought?

Those are much more simple to understand. At the time, they were much, much more interesting to read about.

But that doesn't mean that the difficult content isn't of any value. Quite the contrary.

So write those hard things down.
